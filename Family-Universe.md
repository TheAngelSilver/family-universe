Family Universe Website
Project Overview
The Family Universe Website is a personalized and interactive digital gift for the user’s family, showcasing the unique interests and personalities of each family member. Built with Next.js, it will include a central landing page and individual pages for each member. The design will be whimsical and festive, with subtle superhero-inspired elements, holiday accents, and interactive features.

Key Constraints
Timeframe: Less than 10 days.
Scalability: Must handle 10+ family members with unique pages.
Robustness: Ensure the site is responsive, accessible, and easily extensible.
Tech Stack
Frontend Framework: Next.js (for SSR/SSG capabilities and fast performance).
Styling: Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive design.
Hosting: Vercel (optimized for Next.js, simple deployment).
Animations: Framer Motion for lightweight animations.
Content Storage: Static JSON for quick data handling. Markdown files can be used for individual family member pages if needed.
Optional APIs:
Bible API for Bible verses.
Any fun, lightweight APIs for data visualization or Easter eggs.
Features

1. Central Landing Page
   Purpose: Acts as the homepage and entry point for the family universe.
   Design:
   A magical, interactive family tree (or star map).
   Each family member represented as a clickable "branch" or "star."

   Content:
   Welcome message.
   Links to each family member's personalized page.
2. Individual Family Member Pages
   Each page reflects a family member’s personality, interests, and favorite themes.

Responsive Design:
Test and fix layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
Day 9: Testing and Debugging
Comprehensive Testing:
Ensure all pages load correctly.
Verify animations and interactive elements work as expected.

Time Management Tips
Prioritize Core Features: Build essential features first (e.g., homepage, dynamic pages).
Use Placeholders: Start with basic content and refine later.
Leverage Pre-Built Components: Use Tailwind for styling and avoid overengineering.
Regular Testing: Test as you go to avoid last-minute surprises.
Stretch Goals
If time permits:

Authentication: Add a simple password-protection layer using NextAuth.js.
Form Submissions: Allow family members to add new memories or photos directly.
Data Visualization: Use Chart.js or D3.js for fun family stats.
